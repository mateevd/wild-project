		<p>In May 2015 we hosted huge festival organized for all international Bulgarian groups. 
The idea was to promote bulgarian folk dances and people outside our homeland. 
The event was being prepared for months. We had to think about everything – 
the auditorium, reception of the groups, hotels, music, decorations, 
and dozen other tasks so our guests can feel “at home” and enjoy their stay in Lyon.</p>

<p><img src="/img/lyon/01.jpg" alt="preparation" /></p>

<p><img src="/img/lyon/02.jpg" alt="deco" /></p>

<p>14 groups from  6 European countries accepted our invitation. 
We started at “place Louis Pradel” near the opera of Lyon. 
Of course we needed a special permission to do such an event and fortunately the authorities gave us a green light.</p>

<p><img src="/img/lyon/03.jpg" alt="opera" /></p>

<p>More than 200 people, old and young, men and women and children, 
all of them in traditional costumes filled the square. Bulgarian bagpipes sounded all over the place - 
and all this, in the center of cosmopolitan Lyon, near the Town Hall, in front of the eyes of hundreds 
of spectators of unknown nationalities and races… I can’t even explain what I felt at that moment….</p>

<p>My task tonight was a little different. I was responsible for setting up 
the sound system  and the release of the music throughout the show. 
Not an easy and quite important task. Everything had to be perfect, I had no right to mistake.</p>

<p>Everybody had done a lot of work, so vibrant light was flowing from everywhere - 
the color of the costumes, the colorful wrists in the hair, the bells and pendants, 
the appalling applause after the participation of every line without exception, so positive, 
so good energy gathered In one place …</p>

<p>At the end of the evening it was time for our special surprise. 
After everyone showed their skills and enjoyed a delicious dinner,  “Ot Izvora” 
came out on stage to introduce something different. We danced a traditional can-can, 
we are in France anyway. The whole hall was delighted with our performance, 
the applause was so strong that we were forced to go out for a second run.</p>

<p>The emotion of this first of a kind festival (first but not the last for sure), 
can hardly be described, I’m not even going to try, I’m just proud that I was part 
of a real celebration of Bulgarian traditions. That we showed a small part of the 
Bulgarian spirit and we did it here in Lyon - city I can safely say it’s my second home.</p>

<p>And last but not least we set the beginning of an incredible tradition, because this 
is a festival that is organized every year since then.</p>
