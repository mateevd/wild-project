### Once upon a time… 
This is how all great stories begin - and believe me this one is really great 
(especially if you are Bulgarian in a foreign country).

>It all started here, in our beautiful city of Lyon, in the distant 2011. 
 
Four non-professional dancers decided to create a small dance group - “Ot Izvora”. 
The name literally translates to “From the source”, but not the source you’re probably thinking about. 
For us it’s a source of passion, emotion and energy. 
I still don’t know how and why the idea was born, maybe it was the love to dance, 
maybe they were home sick or maybe there were searching for something – 
something you can find only by experience the Bulgarian dances.

To be honest I don’t care why they started the group – I’m just grateful they did. 
Without it I was going to miss so many amazing memories: new places, new people…  
I always wanted to travel, see the world, but never imagined that I was going to travel around Europe 
(for now, it’s about time we take a trip to another continent) with a dance crew 
(mainly because I used to be a terrible dancer).
