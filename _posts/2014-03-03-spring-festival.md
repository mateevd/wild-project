title: The spring festival

My journey as a “professional” dancer begin somewhere in 2014. 
Just a few months after I join “Ot Izvora” I was already going to my first trip. 
We departed for London to take part in the spring festival hosted there every year.

Of course we take a day to visit London and see all the landmarks. 
You can’t explore the whole city in one day, but we tried. We saw The Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, 
Tower of London, Tower Bridge the entire city is amazing. We were really short on time and didn’t get to 
Buckingham Palace so we decided to leave it for our next trip to London.

Despite the light rain and the cold wind we even did a quick repetition on Trafalgar Square. 
Naturally the square was full of tourists taking photos, but everyone around stopped to watch us. 
Some of the tourists even confused us whit a local group dancing for money. 
It took us some time to explain to them what we were doing.

So it came the moment of truth – my first stage participation. I can’t lie I was really nervous. 
I was training for no more than a few months and I was the youngest in the group so I felt the pressure. 
In spite of a few setbacks (one of the girls fell on top of me but sadly I couldn’t find the photo), 
everything went great and we journeyed back home fill with energy and amazing memories.
