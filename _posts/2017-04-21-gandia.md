This year's international festival took place in Gandia, Spain. 
The city itself is incredible, with long golden beaches and palm trees wherever you look. 
A true paradise. 

We all decided unanimously to go a week early to enjoy the good weather and the sea.
Many of our friends from the other groups had also come in advance so the party was guaranteed. 
It wasn‘t as warm as we hoped, but that did not stop us from relaxing on the beach with volleyball and cold beer.

The day of the festival began (as always) with a general dance in the town 
square and continued with a fashion gorge along the coastline. Each group 
was proudly weaving the flag of Bulgaria and the flag of the country from which it came.

Beautiful spectacle of colorful costumes - authentic, memorable and unmistakable, 
by the greetings of the strangers standing on the sidewalks on holiday in the resort town. 
Everywhere they were waving us - from cafes and shops, from benches and sidewalks, 
from beach volleyball players to recreation and lounging on the deck chairs tourists. 
Definitely not something they can’t see every day.

The scene was located outdoors by the sea. The amazing view only contributed 
to the already great spirit of everyone. The show lasted more than 6 hours. 
We were one of the last groups and while we were waiting for our turn, 
the sun was down – so we danced under the stars.

This is our third big festival, we have gained a lot of experience on stage, 
so there was almost no tension. However, each of us knew he had to perform perfectly - 
we had a whole new choreography especially for tonight. We have been rehearsing for a whole year - 
I have no memory to have worked so hard for another performance.

Whatever the others say - this year we were the best. What we did was more than a dance - 
it was a story, a story about an timeless love. Screams, applause and tears in the eyes - 
this I will remember from these 12 minutes on stage.

With that ends another adventure of “Ot Izvora”. Another amazing and emotional experience. 
But things do not end here – I’m sure  new challenges are waiting for us with new places and new people to explore.  

> And with a group like ours, one thing is for sure – the best is yet to come.
